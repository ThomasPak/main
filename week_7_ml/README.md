## Applied Machine Learning in Python
This is our applied machine learning code. Here you will find a little demo script walking you through the basics of unsupervised and supervised Machine learning. I have annotated the code pretty thoroughly to make it digestible. If there are any additional questions please direct them at nicolas.arning@bdi.ox.ac.uk. If you have no experience in ML I highly recommend reading our report [here](https://dtc-coding-dojo.github.io/main//blog/Machine_Learning_for_Beginners/). 
When you go through the code it's probably a good idea to comment out most of the lines and just run a bit of the code to see what it does. So with all that said just go ahead and dive right in.

                The DTC Coding Dojo is a network of peer support established within the <a href="www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/"> Doctoral Training Centre </a> where DPhil students can come with their computer related problems and get help from within our program. Anyone from within the DTC can attend the problem solving session which are held using a laptop and a projector in the Rex Richards Building.  The person who submitted the problem will work at the laptop but we will guide you through the process and answer any question that arise on the way. No problem is too miniscule and nothing too ridiculous to submit to the dojo. We all come from very different fields and nobody can know everything within the biosciences.

## Things I wish I knew before starting to code
A lot of people want to get into coding because of the limitless possibilities right at your fingertips. This seems like a daunting task at first but if you keep going you will quickly realise that there is a lot of material and training out there which is just waiting to be picked up by the avid learner. Programming is like a giant staircase you need to climb and it is way more rewarding to focus on the little steps that you're climbing than to look at the top of the stairs to see what the professionals are able to do. Programming always looks like black magic even to experienced users, because there are myriads of different branches and techniques out there and not one single person knows it all. I frequently look around the office and 90% of the time I have no ideas what my colleagues are up to. Even if you don't make it up there even understanding what is possible in coding might help you get a better grasp of how experiments can be designed to get the most valuable output. The problem when teaching programming to yourself is that you lack the counsel of more experienced coders to guide you through the process. I am by no means at the end of my own personal learning curve but here are a few things I wish someone had told me before I started to save me countless hours of trial and error. 

### The Life of a Programmer
Before diving into programming itself it might be worth knowing what the programming life looks like. It might be that you were under the wrong impression what coding actually means on a day to day basis. Also that the struggles when starting are shared by all of us at some point might help you through the experience. Before I started one of the first quotes we were shown was by Samuel Beckett

"Ever tried. Ever failed. Don't matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.".

This concept has proven to be very true in my experience. Be under no delusion, you will fail a lot. You will learn to expect failure and be suprised if something works and that is alright. Every time your program fails and you get a different error you fail a little bit better. Eventually it will run smoothly before your eyer littering the screen with output and the feeling of accomplishment is incredible. Overall your productivity will fluctuate a lot. There will be days when nothing seems to be working or you might actually break your program and that is fine. There will also be times when you are reach a flow and hours rush without you noticing. Overall putting in more than 8 hours of productive work will be very difficult as a high amount of focus is necessary. Some of us don't really abide by the 8 hour day and work nights or intermittedly during the day which can also be very productive. Find your productivity sweetspots during the day and make good use of them. Also we all get distracted during work. It's fine to browse different sites on the side but one can get easily lost in some rabbit hole. A 25 work to 5 minutes of break rythm has shown to be very efficient. Over time you will also get better at focussing for long stretches at a time. Everything gets easier over time in programming. 

Programming is no black magic and programmers are usually no wizards. Not everyone knows every command by heart, coding is no vocabulary test. It is better to know what exactly is possible and where to find it and then simply google the specific problem. Writing a program often is like choosing the nicest bouqet of flowers from the neighbourhood gardens you find on google. Bundling together different functions from other programs and binding them with your own code is usually a quick and efficient way of arriving at a solution. If you can't find your specific problem anywhere there are most commonly two options: Either you just had an idea nobody ever had before or you're looking at it the wrong way. For me personally it always the latter.

### Programming Life Lessons
There is a few things everyone has to learn very early on the way. To catalyse the learning process I tried to come up with a few hints before getting started. 
* Focus on one language before getting started. This is a very important choice and depends on what you're trying to do. A good generaly language is Python which is used and loved by many. It is very readable and doesn't have a learning curve as steep as other languages. I would recommend R if you are trying to learn coding as a means of using applied statistics. Matlab is the programming choice of most mathematicians and is also very helpful when doing image analysis. C will force you to learn a lot about computing architecture and has a very steep learning curve. If you don't know which one to go for Python is probably a good call
* Text editor choice is key. This is where you will live on most days coding. Sublime is one of the nicest text editors on a graphical interface and is used by most programmers today. Vim has no graphical interface and only function in terminal. It has a steep learning curve but can be extremely powerful capable hands. There are a few others out there and I reccomend reading a few top 10s on the subject before choosing one. Once you have a favourite it is probably a good idea to print out a cheat sheet with all the hotkeys and pin it next to your screen. Hotkeys will speed up your coding by a lot.
